# NYC Permits, Demographics and the Economy: Why Building Permits Matter

**Skills used**: data cleaning and visualization, exploratory data analysis, linear regression, multiple regression

  With Wall Street investors up in arms over Trump’s ongoing trade war with China, the U.S. economy, a topic always luring the background for the average U.S. citizen and of utmost importance to the U.S. politician, is once again at the forefront of the nation’s mind. It’s natural to worry about where the economy is headed; it’s a concern of everyday life. While small talk may be filled with mentions of the stock market and the jobs report, one key indicator of economic health rarely comes up: building permits. 

  Building permits are one of several economic measures known as leading indicators. These are measures that change just before economic shifts and can thus predict economic changes before they occur. Building permits must be obtained from a regulatory body before performing any type of major construction work on new or existing buildings. Construction is an important economic activity that encompasses investment and employment among other things. Thus, building permits can inform us of the future state of the economy, especially when considering the types of permits issued. An increase in commercial building permits may indicate business and commerce growth, while an increase in residential building permits might indicate population and consumer growth, for example. The relevance of New York City building permits to the economy was explored by comparing it to unemployment data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

**Findings**: 
* The number of building permits issued is negatively correlated with the national unemployment rate, overall, which confirms that relationship between building permits and the economy. 
* That finding remains the same when the data is segmented based on whether the project is commercial and a misleading positive correlation is found amongst residential data. 
* New building construction is correlated with increased permit length, while demolitions is correlated  with decreased permit length. 
* While most other boroughs have higher volumes of permits for work on existing buildings, Staten Island had a high volume of new building permits issued during the time period selected.*

**Future Exploration**: 

*As noted in a 2011 report by  The Furman Center For Real Estate & Urban Policy, Staten Island is the least populated borough in the city and has a higher share of underdeveloped land, so it makes sense that new construction is the most prevalent as there aren’t as many existing structures.
